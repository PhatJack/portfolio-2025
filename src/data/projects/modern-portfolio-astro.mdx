# Building a Modern Portfolio with Astro and TailwindCSS

In today's competitive tech landscape, having a standout portfolio is crucial for developers. After exploring various frameworks, I chose **Astro** combined with **TailwindCSS** to build my personal portfolio. Here's why this combination is perfect for modern web development and how I implemented it.

## Why Astro? üöÄ

Astro has quickly become my favorite framework for content-heavy websites. Here's what makes it special:

:::tip
If you're building a content-heavy website like a blog or portfolio, Astro's performance benefits are immediately noticeable. The zero-JavaScript approach means lightning-fast load times!
:::

### Performance by Default
- **Zero JavaScript by default**: Astro ships HTML and CSS, adding JavaScript only when needed
- **Island Architecture**: Interactive components are loaded independently
- **Build-time optimization**: Most rendering happens at build time, not runtime

### Developer Experience
- **Framework agnostic**: Use React, Vue, Svelte, or vanilla JavaScript
- **File-based routing**: Simple and intuitive routing system
- **Built-in optimizations**: Image optimization, CSS bundling, and more

:::important
The framework-agnostic approach means you're not locked into any specific UI library. You can mix and match components from different frameworks in the same project!
:::

## Project Structure üìÅ

```
src/
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ components/          # Reusable UI components
‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ includes/       # Header, footer, sidebar
‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ project/        # Project-specific components
‚îÇ   ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ about/          # About page components
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ data/               # MDX blog posts and project data
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ layouts/            # Page layouts
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ pages/              # File-based routing
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ styles/             # Global styles and themes
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ utils/              # Utility functions
```

## Key Features Implemented üõ†Ô∏è

:::note
The following features showcase the power of combining Astro with modern web technologies to create a fast, accessible, and beautiful portfolio.
:::

### 1. Dynamic Theme System
I implemented a custom theme system that goes beyond basic light/dark mode:

```javascript
// Theme color picker with HSL color space
function setHue(hue) {
  document.documentElement.style.setProperty("--theme-hue", hue.toString());
  document.documentElement.style.setProperty("--theme-primary", `hsl(${hue}, 70%, 60%)`);
  // ... more color variables
}
```

**Benefits:**
- Users can customize the primary color
- Maintains accessibility contrast ratios
- Smooth color transitions across the site

### 2. MDX-Powered Blog System
Using MDX allows me to write rich, interactive blog posts:

```astro
// astro.config.mjs
remarkPlugins: [
  remarkGfm,        // GitHub Flavored Markdown
  remarkBreaks,     // Line break support
  remarkEmoji,      // Emoji support
  remarkReadingTime // Reading time estimation
]
```

**Features:**
- ‚úÖ GitHub Flavored Markdown support
- ‚úÖ Syntax highlighting with `rehype-pretty-code`
- ‚úÖ Automatic heading anchors
- ‚úÖ External link handling
- ‚úÖ Reading time estimation

### 3. Responsive Design with TailwindCSS
TailwindCSS provides the perfect balance of utility and maintainability:

```html
<div class="w-full flex flex-col lg:flex-row gap-8 items-start">
  <aside class="w-full lg:w-80 lg:sticky lg:top-8">
    <!-- Sidebar content -->
  </aside>
  <main class="flex-1 min-w-0">
    <!-- Main content -->
  </main>
</div>
```

**Key Benefits:**
- Mobile-first responsive design
- Consistent spacing and typography
- Easy dark mode implementation
- Minimal CSS bundle size

## Performance Optimizations üîß

### Image Optimization
Astro's built-in image optimization automatically:
- Converts images to modern formats (WebP, AVIF)
- Generates responsive image sets
- Lazy loads images below the fold

```astro
<Image 
  src={projectImage} 
  alt="Project screenshot"
  width={600}
  height={400}
  format="webp"
/>
```

### CSS Optimization
- **CSS-in-JS elimination**: Pure CSS with TailwindCSS
- **Critical CSS inlining**: Above-the-fold styles are inlined
- **Unused CSS removal**: TailwindCSS purges unused styles

### JavaScript Optimization
- **Selective hydration**: Only interactive components load JavaScript
- **Code splitting**: Automatic splitting by route and component
- **Tree shaking**: Unused code is eliminated

## Development Workflow üîÑ

### 1. Local Development
```bash
pnpm dev  # Hot reload with instant updates
```

### 2. Content Creation
Writing blog posts is as simple as creating `.mdx` files:
```markdown
---
title: "My Blog Post"
date: "2025-01-17"
tags: ["Web Development", "Astro"]
---

# My Blog Post
Content goes here...
```

### 3. Deployment
```bash
pnpm build  # Generates optimized static files
```
