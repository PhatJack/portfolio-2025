# Enhanced Markdown Features Demo

This post demonstrates the new markdown extensions we've added to make the blog more beautiful and functional.

## Mathematical Expressions

We now support LaTeX-style mathematical expressions:

Inline math: $E = mc^2$

Block math:
$$
\frac{d}{dx}\left( \int_{0}^{x} f(u) \, du\right) = f(x)
$$

## Admonitions and Callouts

### Note Admonition
:::note
This is a note admonition. It's perfect for highlighting important information that readers should be aware of.
:::

### Tip Admonition
:::tip
This is a tip admonition. Use this to share helpful tips and best practices with your readers.
:::

### Important Admonition
:::important
This is an important admonition. Use this for critical information that users must not miss.
:::

### Caution Admonition
:::caution
This is a caution admonition. Use this to warn users about potential issues or things to be careful about.

## GitHub Repository Cards

Here are some examples of GitHub repository cards:

::github{repo="astro-js/astro"}

::github{repo="tailwindlabs/tailwindcss"}

::github{repo="microsoft/vscode"}

## Enhanced Code Blocks

The code blocks now have better syntax highlighting:

```javascript
// Example of enhanced JavaScript syntax highlighting
const blogPost = {
  title: "Enhanced Markdown Features",
  author: "Portfolio Author",
  tags: ["markdown", "demo"],
  published: new Date(),
  
  render() {
    return `
      <article>
        <h1>${this.title}</h1>
        <p>By ${this.author}</p>
        <div class="tags">
          ${this.tags.map(tag => `<span class="tag">${tag}</span>`).join('')}
        </div>
      </article>
    `;
  }
};

console.log(blogPost.render());
```

```python
# Python example with syntax highlighting
def fibonacci(n):
    """Generate Fibonacci sequence up to n terms."""
    if n <= 0:
        return []
    elif n == 1:
        return [0]
    elif n == 2:
        return [0, 1]
    
    sequence = [0, 1]
    for i in range(2, n):
        sequence.append(sequence[i-1] + sequence[i-2])
    
    return sequence

# Generate first 10 Fibonacci numbers
fib_sequence = fibonacci(10)
print(f"First 10 Fibonacci numbers: {fib_sequence}")
```

## Regular Markdown Features

All the regular markdown features still work perfectly:

### Lists
- Unordered list item 1
- Unordered list item 2
  - Nested item 1
  - Nested item 2

1. Ordered list item 1
2. Ordered list item 2
   1. Nested ordered item 1
   2. Nested ordered item 2

### Text Formatting
- **Bold text**
- *Italic text*
- `Inline code`
- ~~Strikethrough text~~

### Links and Images
- [External link](https://astro.build)
- [Internal link](/about)

### Blockquotes
> This is a blockquote. It's useful for highlighting quotes or important passages from other sources.
> 
> Multiple paragraphs are supported in blockquotes.

## Emoji Support

We also support emoji in markdown! ðŸŽ‰ âœ¨ ðŸš€

:tada: :sparkles: :rocket: :computer: :coffee:

## Conclusion

These enhanced markdown features make the blog much more expressive and visually appealing. The admonitions help organize content better, GitHub cards showcase repositories elegantly, and mathematical expressions support technical content.
